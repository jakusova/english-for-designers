### WORK EXPERIENCE
#### FREELANCE - Prague - PHOTO/VIDEOGRAPHER

2020 - present

I focus on telling love stories. Storytelling through capturing weddings, portraits, family sessions, and recording podcasts. I often work solo or with my partner in a small team.





#### KAUFBAUER - Prague - GRAPHIC DESIGN

2021 - present

I design infographics and photograph products for a Germany-based waste management company. You know — those bright green city trash cans — and compose bins to reduce and recycle organic waste. (Fun stuff like that.) And I get to work remotely from home in Prague.





#### ROBEETO - PRAGUE - GRAPHIC DESIGN

2019

I designed and managed social media content for an online service marketplace. They offer (or offered, do they still exist?) various services, from babysitting and dog walking to photography. I collaborated remotely with a small team of five for one year/six months (or how ever long you worked there).
