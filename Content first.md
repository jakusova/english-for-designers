### LOVE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MAGICAL FOREST

This wedding was unique to me. Veronika and Martin are my close friends and their love story started at this children's camp. They met here as kids and got married at camp. It is true love story.

This whole wedding was a little different. It was held in a camp in the middle of the woods, wedding guests slept in tents, the bride and groom were married by the groom's brother, or the fact that the evening party was held in a church.


All the wedding guests knew each other well, so the atmosphere was just unique and I felt like I am member of this big family.

### What I enjoyed the most was the flower throwing tradition. Instead of the unmarried ladies catching a flower, they shot with an air gun at a target.
