Hello, my name is Zuzana Jaku코ov치 and I would like to show you the presentation of my bachelor thesis.

游꿘 Here you can watch the video 俱뫮잺  https://youtu.be/SIRMnygnk1U


I would start from the very beginning, when it came time to choose the topic of my bachelor thesis, I was quite clear that I wanted to do personal branding. The reason was and is clear. I wanted to connect my bachelor's thesis to something I love and something I want to continue to pursue in the future, and I want to do it fully. My personal brand is in the wedding industry. My partner Michal Bares and I are wedding photo-video creators. 

My personal brand is different from other photo-video productions mainly because it creates a community of people by supporting other wedding vendors. Thus, beyond our photo-video service, the brand tells the stories of other creators, helping to educate future newlyweds who are deciding what vendors to book. Additionally, the brand reflects reality. It strives to tell real life stories. 

My personal brand is called Colon. I chose this name because it fits perfectly for my purpose of capturing memories, telling stories and standing at the beginning of new stories. Through the colon symbol itself comes the entire communication of the brand. The communication always consists of two parts, the one before and after the colon, which form a perfect whole. 

# LOGO

The logo contains the full name of the brand, Dvojte캜ka, in the Albra Black font. This font is creative and breaks away from the standard wedding and overly decorative fonts. Nevertheless, it respects the symbolism of the wedding mood and is easy to read. The symbol of the colon sign always appears after the name Colon. This symbol conveys the questioning, the brand's affection for its customers, the communication that flows between the two parties, the brand and the customer.

# COLORS

The whole visual style is accompanied by shades of colors green, orange and cream. This colour palette has been created to look youthful, still pleasing and to have the potential to attract new customers. Competing brands in the segment are mainly characterised by bland earthy and pastel colours. Therefore, a combination of green
and orange, which are highly contrasting colours and thus create an energetic combination. Each of the individual colours represents aspects of the wedding day and mood.
- GREEN - nature, seriousness, mystery, confidence hospitality
- MINT - tenderness, freedom, peace, growth
- ORANGE - positive energy, youth, evening parties, sunsets
- CREAM - bride, dress, new beginnings, purity, innocence

# SYMBOL
---
The main communication element is the colon symbol. Through it, communication flows between the two parties, creating a single whole. The whole communication is based on the dialogue between the two parties and the following response.
The colon characterises:
- A means of communication
- The symbolism of the two
- The beginning of new stories
- The bride and groom
- Newlyweds and suppliers and more

# TYPOGRAPHY
---
I chose Albra as the main font for the brand. 
I also used this font to create the logotype itself. It is a serif font that is distinctive, creative and yet easy to read. It represents the side of the Colon, the side that asks.

![albra-04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116068266/236230055-56d039f0-1b26-4958-a6b8-29b91797090f.png)

I chose Montserrat as a complementary font. This font is calm, clean and clear compared to the main font. It stands on the page after the colon, where it always completes the communication and forms a whole with the main font. It's great to apply to communications that complement creative communications and convey important information.

# PILLARS
---

These are the pillars on which the entire brand stands and from which all communication and content is based.

# COMMUNICATION

Thanks to the main communication symbol of the colon and the principle of dialogue, the brand's communication is very diverse, playful and almost inexhaustible.
I created the main slogan for the brand: "with love: to stories". The main slogan and other variations of it are written into the entire brand communication - on the website, social networks, promotional materials, etc.
The visual style of the brand is based on distinctive text and colour, emotions flowing through photos and videos, authenticity and storytelling.

# ON-LINE

WEBSITE
---
One of the most important communication channels for my personal brand is the website, through which customers can order the photo-video service itself. Among other things, the website offers other very important parts of the whole brand communication. The website offers the following categories:
- Landing page
- About us
- Svatblog
- Suppliers 
- Form

INSTAGRAM
---
The main social platform I want to focus on the most is Instagram. It's a powerful tool for creators, using visual content to reach customers in a great way. Colon's target audience is actively using this platform and it's so easy to engage them through Instagram. As a wedding photo-video creator, Colon presents itself at its best. This is aided by her always having a well thought out and good looking overall feed image. A user's Instagram gallery should give a unified impression, reflect the brand's philosophy and support its image.
When designing the Instagram posts, I chose the combination of colours and tonality of the photos that Dvojte캜ka wants to present itself with. Communicating authentic emotions through documentary style and preserving precious moments. Among other things, Dvojte캜ka in the feed itself focuses on conveying interesting advice to customers and supporting wedding suppliers. So it doesn't just focus on its posts, but also on education and support.

YOUTUBE
---
This platform is primarily used for viewing and embedding longer formats of video content. The couple will predominantly use this platform to showcase their wedding videos. Among other things, it will also focus on creating educational video content to target potential and existing customers.
This content will be created in collaboration with wedding suppliers, to cross-promote and showcase the services and products offered. As far as the suppliers offering wedding venues are concerned, this will include guided tours of the venues with the aim of introducing and conveying the most important and interesting information for the future newlyweds. Other wedding suppliers will be contributing their personal experiences to the video content through the form of a podcast, where we will invite them in order to present the offer and possibilities of a particular supplier.
The Colonet's podcast will be called You Want Me: I Want You. This name again reflects the communication game and the youthfulness of the brand.

# PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS

BUSINESS CARD
---
When creating the card, I projected the philosophical aspects of the Colon into it, namely its youth and play with the text. On the front I placed a game with letters - the figure eight. In it are hidden concepts connected with the Colon. They are concepts such as love, emotion, documentary, camerawoman, photographer, suppliers, bride, husband, memory, dialogue, story, wedding, life and finally the Colon itself. The octal is made using the brand's main font. The front of the card could change over time, making the card a limited edition.
The back of the card features the logo itself and an additional "for next time" claim. There are also basic contacts, which are done in a complementary font.

WEDDING BOX
---
The visual style is also reflected in the wedding boxes that we give to every couple who has their wedding day documented by us. The newlyweds will receive three boxes. The largest box holds two smaller ones, which are dedicated to the bride and groom. The smaller boxes thus again symbolize the number two and together with the large box form one unit. This idea again reflects the very philosophy of the Double Box. Among other things, the wedding box will contain a couple of printed photos, a pexes for the newlyweds with their photos, smaller merch, a voucher for printing photo books and stickers of the Colon.

# MERCHANDISE
The merch itself I decided to reflect the youthfulness of the brand, the playfulness with the text and its energy. The merch supports the overall visual style of the brand with its colour palette, tonality of language, graphic style and the use of the colon symbol together in a combination of dialogue from both sides. The merch thus playfully addresses the target customer group. Its language and visual image should entertain and spread brand awareness. Some of the products could be produced for sale in the future.

PEXESSO
---
Pexeso will serve as a gift for the newlyweds in the wedding gift box. It will always be personalised to the couple and will carry their wedding photographs. When two identical pictures are painted together, the perfect couple is created, and so the memory game shares its essence with the philosophy of the Colon.

![pexesso](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116068266/236237154-9fdd4040-e1f9-4aa7-9153-7fcc5ae1b169.jpg)

SLIPPERS
---
The slippers bring back the symbolism of the pair, where a dialogue is created on both slippers while they communicate with each other. On the right slipper is depicted the inscription "I am the one: right" and on the left slipper is the inscription "I have the one: right". This creates a dialogue between the two parties as in all brand communication.

![FLIP-FLOP-nove](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116068266/236237333-c5ec5606-82f0-4111-9d42-93b52327c0fb.jpg)

SHORTS
---
On the shorts appears the typical photographic phrase "beware: a bird will fly", which hides a double meaning. The sweatpants are thus able to entertain and, thanks to the humour used, are better able to get into the minds of potential and existing customers. Trenky could be part of a newlyweds' wedding gift box.

KITCHEN GLOVES
---
Women in particular might appreciate kitchen mitts. When a groom marries his bride, she is the right woman for him. I apply this idea to the oven mitts, both of which are also real, and therein lies their wit.
The potholders are created using a corporate colour scheme. One mitten says "I'm the one:right" and the other says "I have the:right one".
