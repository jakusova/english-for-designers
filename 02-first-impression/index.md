### There is value keeping it real.

I have been filming and photographing weddings for three years. I like to do it in a natural rhythm. I love when souls and hearts of everybody, including mine merge into one whole.

I cherish the presents of beauty and happiness all around. I still find it mysterious how much my clients always touch me heart with a feeling I have known them forever.

# Baby steps of wedding clip

### FIRTS STEP

![first-step](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116068266/216763431-bc7cd552-bb81-4cc8-ac69-f0d326a08744.jpg)


The first step is that clients contact me on email or instagram. They let me know the date of their wedding and I will send them the pricing. Once we agree on everything, we can start creating and planning together.

### LETS GO ON A DATE

![lets-go-on-date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116068266/216763447-8ab072cc-0388-4200-b126-aaf67f980e72.jpg)


Let's go to on a date to their favorite coffee shop or the place where couple went on first date. At this point, we finally get to know each other face to face. We can talk about all the details of the wedding day. I always want to know every single detail and all the possible surprises. So I can be at the right moment in the right place.

### D DAY

I don't want to describe how wedding day looks like. Everyone can imagine this. But for me it is very hard to not cry behind the camera during ceremonies.
# They get me every. Single. Time.

I try to enjoy every wedding as much as possible. Everyone at the wedding is in a good mood and the whole atmosphere is incredible. I most enjoy the moments with the bride and groom during the couple session. It is always very intimate when they are lonely together and can enjoy eachother.

### EDITING

First I came back from the wedding, transferred all the data to the computer and that's where the real fun begins. The hardest part for me is choosing the right music.
I always choose a different one that fits the couple and also fits the mood of the wedding day. The second hardest thing for me is creating a unique story.
