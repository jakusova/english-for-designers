This bachelor's thesis deals with the process of creating a strong and successful personal brand Dvojtečka, operating in the wedding industry and providing photo-video services. This brand is unique in that it not only offers wedding photography and videography, but also creates unique content through collaboration with other wedding vendors and emphasizes building relationships with newlyweds and customers through mutual communication. The aim of the thesis is to create a design and concept that will be attractive to customers and support the brand's philosophy.
The theoretical part is dedicated to explaining basic concepts and principles related to strategy, communication, visual identity of personal brand, and analysis of the market and competitive brands.
The practical part focuses primarily on the creation of the Dvojtečka brand itself and its consistent visual identity. The result of the thesis should be the creation of a recognizable, successful, and competitive style that is applied to the logo, brand communication, and promotional materials.
