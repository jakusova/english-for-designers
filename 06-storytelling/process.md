# FULL TIME CONTENT CREATOR

✏️ Prosess of my work
---

Hello! Let me guide you through the creation of this presentation. In the beginning I thought about a lot of topics that I have both related to emotions or to my work. I tried to choose a topic that would be enriching and useful to others. In the end, I found a few topics that I enjoyed and wanted to delve deeper into.

At that moment I was thinking about my main topic and its title. In the end, I chose the issue of content because I deal with this problem on a daily basis as well. Each of us is also a content creator, even if we may not be fully aware of it. 

Gradually I started to sketch the main points of my presentation.

And here is again the final talk if you wanna take a look at how it turned out! ☺️
