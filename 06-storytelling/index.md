 - speak how you speak
 - do things that make you happy
 - share you daylife 
 
this authentic approach is something that will create a community and draw people to you.
 
donâ€˜t pretend youâ€˜re someone else = people will always know

_BEHIND THE SCENES_
---

show how you do things, what problems could arise, tell the solution to the problem!

_EXAPMLE_ 

camera problem speaking
I always have trouble talking on camera. So I pretend I'm talking to my old friend and when that doesn't work, I flip up my camera screen so I can see myself while filming. That always helps me. 

_CREATE COMMUNITY_
---
Being authentic is something that will create a community of people with the same interests or perhaps philosophy.

# AUDIENCE FIRST

 _FOCUS ON YOUR AUDIENCE AND MONEY WILL COME_
 ---
 
I always create content for my audience, not for me, but for others. It is extremely important to listen what your audience wants.

 _HIGH QUALITY OF AUDIENCE
 ---
No one wants to get thousands of people following or subscribing to your channel, and none of them are actually engaged with anything you say.

_PICK YOU NICHE
---

NICHE = things or topics that are unique for you
Choose the topic you actually enjoy and you are passionate about. If you have strong niche = you gona be able to hold a conversation with your audience.

Example = if you are awesome at teaching kids math, you should start your own YouTube channel to teach teenagers math.
___

# Own your content

_CREATE WEBSITES OR BLOG
---
Social media platforms are great tool for our contet, but we donâ€˜t own any of them.
We need to have our own place of business where we can serve people content we own = WEBSITES OR BLOG

My story
Someone deletes all your content from your instagram. Thatâ€˜s something that can really piss you off, right?

# SUBSTANCE VS AESTHETICS

_FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE OVER AESTHETICS
---
Instead of focusing too much on having the right filter or if the photos look aesthetically together, you should focus on the substance of the content youâ€˜re creating.
All of your content should have a purpose

INSPIRE someone?
EDUCATE someone?
ENTERTAIN someone?

focus more on the purpose than how it looks like
___

# NEVER STOP LEARNING

_invest in yourself personal development is so important_

_CONSISTENLY HAVE A BEGINNERâ€˜S MINDSET
---

In the beginning, we spent a lot of time learning and trying to learn more about our niche. At this point, our content is better, more entertaining, inspiring and educational.
When we start to see some results, we take our foot off the gas. We think weâ€˜re growing now, and then we stop learning and trying to make our content better.

_WELL I ALREADY KNOW THIS
---

itâ€˜s not a good approach for you brand. Learning things twice or multiple times is the most effective way of learning.
You may already know some parts of what the book or article says, but you canâ€˜t know everything.
Thereâ€˜s always information or facts we havenâ€˜t heard before.

you should always developing yourself in your skills and you continue to get better and better
