# 1) What did you like most about this course?

I liked most was your friendly and open attitude. I've never felt so comfortable in an English class. 😊 I take away a lot of knowledge from your classes, not only in the English language, but also the ability to present better, use the right tone of voice, use the new Github app, and generally think about problems differently than one would expect. It was't just an English class, but a friendly session with a great person with a lot of knowledge.

# 2) What did you like least about this course?

Maybe the amount of homework 📓 kept me busy for long periods of time, which was not good for my senior year. 👩🏼‍🎓 But that was probably because I was making things more complicated than they needed to be. Like always. 😂😅

# 3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?

I learned how to use markdown Be more confident during the presentation The plain text can be very helpful

# 4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?

I remember an activity in groups at the very start of the course about the description of a picture. That was cool and fun. 😊

# 5) What’s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?

Completing my bachelor's thesis, which is also my personal brand that I will be using. ❤️

# 6) What’s one thing you learned about yourself?

What I have found is that I can do more than I think and that a positive attitude is the foundation to success.

# 7) What’s one thing you could have done better?

I may have been more active during the course, but I regret that I did not provide more specific feedback to others and that I was not confident in my presentation. There is always something that I can improve and thanks to this I can move forward. 🤞

# 8) What’s one thing I could have done better?

Nothing. ❤️ As I mentioned, your class was the best English class of my life. If half the teachers had your fun, modern, smart approach, schools would be overcrowded. I loved that you actively interacted with us off-school time, pleasant conversation flowed in class, and even if someone didn't have something done, you didn't get angry.

# 9) What’s one thing you would add or change about this course?

Maybe add more group activities during class. 😇

# 10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?

I'd say it's the best English class they've ever had. I'd tell them to do every homework assignment because it'll take them incredibly far. Make sure they don't miss a single class because every class is different and unique. Don't be afraid to speak up or make mistakes. No one is perfect, and with your helpfulness and support, mistakes are just more steps towards a better self. 🤩
